\arguments{
\item{...}{One or more objects of class \code{confMeta}.}

\item{type}{A character vector of length 1 or 2. Indicates what type of
plot should be returned. Accepted is any combination of \code{"p"} and
\code{"forest"}. Defaults to \code{c("p", "forest")}.}

\item{diamond_height}{Numeric vector of length 1. Indicates the maximal
possible height of the diamonds in the forest plot. Defaults to 0.5.
This argument is only relevant if \code{type} contains \code{"forest"} and will
be ignored otherwise.}

\item{v_space}{Numeric vector of length 1. Indicates the vertical space
between two diamonds in the forest plot. Defaults to 1.5.
This argument is only relevant if \code{type} contains \code{"forest"} and will
be ignored otherwise.}

\item{scale_diamonds}{Logical vector of lenght 1. Accepted values are either
\code{TRUE} (default) or \code{FALSE}. If \code{TRUE}, the diamond is rescaled to the
interval [0, 1] in cases where the maximum of the p-value
function is not equal to 1. This argument is only relevant if \code{type}
contains \code{"forest"} and will be ignored otherwise.}

\item{show_studies}{Logical vector of lenght 1. Accepted values are either
\code{TRUE} (default) or \code{FALSE}. If \code{TRUE}, the forest plot shows the
confidence intervals for the individual effect estimates. Otherwise,
the intervals are suppressed. This argument is only relevant if \code{type}
contains \code{"forest"} and will be ignored otherwise.}

\item{drapery}{Either \code{TRUE} (default) or \code{FALSE}. If \code{TRUE}, the individual
study effects are represented as drapery plots. If \code{FALSE} the studies
are represented by a simple vertical line at their effect estimates.}

\item{reference_methods}{A character vector of length 1, 2, 3 or 4.
Specifies which reference meta-analysis methods should be shown in
the plot. Valid options are any subset of
\code{c("fe", "re", "hk", "hc")}, which correspond to:
- \code{"fe"}: fixed-effect meta-analysis
- \code{"re"}: random-effects meta-analysis
- \code{"hk"}: Hartung–Knapp adjustment
- \code{"hc"}: Henmi–Copas adjustment.

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode">}}\preformatted{**Note:** at most one of `"fe"` or `"re"` can be included at a time.
These two methods are mutually exclusive, as only one baseline
meta-analysis model (fixed or random effects) can be displayed in
a single plot. Defaults to `c("re", "hk", "hc")`.
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}}

\item{xlim}{Numeric vector of length 2. Global limits for the x-axis.
If \code{NULL}, limits are calculated automatically.}

\item{xlim_p}{Numeric vector of length 2. Specific x-axis limits for the
p-value plot. Overrides \code{xlim}.}

\item{xlim_forest}{Numeric vector of length 2. Specific x-axis limits for
the forest plot. Overrides \code{xlim}.}

\item{same_xlim}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, forces the p-value plot to use the
same x-axis limits as the forest plot. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{xlab}{Either NULL (default) or a character vector of length 1 which
is used as the label for the x-axis.}

\item{n_breaks}{approximate number of tick marks to display
on the x-axis. Defaults to \code{7}}

\item{bayesmeta}{Either \code{NULL} (default) or an object of class \code{"bayesmeta"},
typically created using \code{\link[bayesmeta:bayesmeta]{bayesmeta::bayesmeta()}}. When provided, the
posterior median (or mean, depending on the \code{mu_estimate} setting) and
95\% credible interval are displayed as an additional diamond at the
bottom of the forest plot for direct comparison with the frequentist
confidence intervals. This argument has no effect on the \emph{p}-value
function plot.}

\item{n_points}{Number of points used to create the p value plot. n_points = 10000 gives high resolution
default is 1000 for efficiency.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{ggplot} containing the specified plot(s).
}
\description{
Plot one or more \code{confMeta} objects. Currently, this function
can create two types of plots, the \emph{p}-value function and the
forest plot. This allows to compare different \emph{p}-value functions with
each other.

Optionally, a Bayesian meta-analysis object created with the
\code{\link[bayesmeta:bayesmeta]{bayesmeta::bayesmeta()}} function can be supplied via the \code{bayesmeta} argument.
When provided, its posterior summary is displayed as an additional diamond
at the bottom of the forest plot for comparison with the frequentist methods
}
\note{
The function extract esplicitly the 95\% credible intervals from the 'bayesmeta' object
If the bayesian model was fit using a different credible level, the function will crash
