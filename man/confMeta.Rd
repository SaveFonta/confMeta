\arguments{
\item{estimates}{A vector containing the normalized individual effect
estimates. Must be of the same length as \code{SEs} and coercible to
type 'double'.}

\item{SEs}{The standard errors of the normalized individual effect estimates.
Must be of the same length as \code{estimates} and coercible to
type 'double'.}

\item{study_names}{Either \code{NULL} (the default) or a vector that can
be coerced to type 'character'. Must be of the same length as
arguments \code{estimates} and \code{SEs}. The vector is used to
differentiate the individual studies. For more information, check out the
Details section.}

\item{conf_level}{The confidence level. Must be a numeric vector of length
one with its value being in (0, 1).}

\item{fun}{A function that combines individual effect estimates and the
corresponding standard errors into a combined p-value. The function must
have arguments named 'estimates', 'SEs', and 'mu'.
Additional arguments are also allowed, but these must either have a
default value or be passed via the \code{...} argument.
For more information, see the Details section.}

\item{fun_name}{A character vector of length 1. The vector serves as an
identifier for the function \code{fun} and is only used as a label in
plots. The default is just the literal that the function \code{fun} is
bound to.}

\item{w}{An optional numeric vector of weights for the studies. Must be of
the same length as \code{estimates} and \code{SEs}, finite, and non-negative.
If \code{NULL} (the default), equal weights are assumed. Used by weighted
p-value combination functions such as the weighted Edgington method.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to \code{fun}. See the Details
section.}
}
\value{
An S3 object of class \code{confMeta}. The object contains the
following elements:
\describe{
\item{estimates}{The normalized individual effect estimates.}
\item{SEs}{The standard errors of the normalized individual effect
estimates.}
\item{study_names}{The names of the individual studies.}
\item{conf_level}{The confidence level.}
\item{w}{The weights for the studies (if specified). If \code{NULL},
equal weights were assumed.}
\item{individual_cis}{The confidence intervals for the
individual effects. The exact calculation of these intervals
can be found in the Details section.}
\item{p_fun}{A function with arguments named 'estimates', 'SEs',
'conf_level', and 'mu'. This is the p-value function that is
used to find the combined confidence intervals.}
\item{fun_name}{The name of the function. It is only used in plots
as a legend entry.}
\item{joint_cis}{The combined confidence interval(s). These are
calculated by finding the mean values where the $p$-value
function is larger than the confidence level in element
\code{conf_level}.}
\item{gamma}{The local minima within the range of the individual
effect estimates. Column 'x' refers to the mean \code{mu} and
column 'y' contains the corresponding $p$-value.}
\item{p_max}{The local maxima of the $p$-value function. The
column 'x' refers to the mean \code{mu} and the column 'y' contains
the corresponding $p$-value.}
\item{p_0}{The value of the $p$-value at \code{mu} = 0}
\item{comparison_cis}{Combined confidence intervals calculated
with other methods. These can be used for comparison
purposes. Currently, these other methods are random effects
(REML), Hartung & Knapp, and Henmi & Copas.}
\item{comparison_p_0}{The same as in element 'p_0' but for the
comparison methods (Random effects, Hartung & Knapp,
Henmi & Copas).}

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode">}}\preformatted{# Function arguments

The argument `study_names` is used to differentiate between the
different individual estimates. If the argument is set to `NULL`,
the element 'study_names' in the return object will just be a
character vector with elements "Study n" where n is a number from 1
to `length(estimates)`. These names are only used in some of the
`autoplot` methods.

The argument `fun` must have arguments 'estimates', 'SEs',
and 'mu' but it can also have further arguments.
However, these must either have a default value or
need to be passed via the `...` argument. If there
are additional arguments passed via `...`,
`confMeta` will internally create a new
function that calls `fun` with the additional arguments fixed.
Thus, any argument passed via `...` overwrites existing
defaults.
Since this is the p-value function that is used to calculate the
combined confidence interval(s), it should return a vector of class
'numeric' with value(s) in the interval [0, 1].

The argument `w` allows assigning weights to the studies. If not 
specified, all studies receive equal weight (`w = rep(1, n)`). 
Weighted p-value combination functions (e.g. weighted Edgington) 
will use these values directly; other functions that do not depend 
on weights will ignore `w`.

# Confidence intervals

The `individual_cis` are calculated as
\deqn{x_{i} \pm \Phi^{-1}{\text{conf_level}} \cdot \sigma_{i}}
where \eqn{x_{i}} corresponds to the elements of vector
`estimates`, \eqn{\Phi^{-1}} is the quantile function of
the standard normal distribution, conf_level is the confidence
level passed as argument `conf_level`, and
\eqn{\sigma_{i}}, are the standard errors passed in argument
`SEs`.

The boundaries of the confidence intervals returned in element
`joint_cis` are found by searching where the function returned
in element 'p_fun' is equal to 1-`conf_level`.
